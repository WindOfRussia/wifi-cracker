# WIFI-CRACKER v1.4 (dev\_build3) #

WIFI-CRACKER is a bash script that automates wifi trickery.
Proof of concept and created for educational purposes after watching the WIFI Workshop episodes (hak5).
As far as I'm concerned, there isn't any wifi related bash script as good as this one on the Internet; and I searched a lot!

Featuring all the fun tools you need for some wifi fun!!
aircrack-ng; macchanger; reaver and much more.
